## :detective: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis 

Let's clean the data set and do a first exporatory analysis to check what's the data look like. You can find the results in the Movies.ipynb file

## :computer:  Machine Learning

In the Movies.ipynb file, you can find different algorithms applied to the dataset
- KNN tested with various metrics
- K-Means
- Hierarchical tree

## :rocket: API

Once the best algorithm has been selected, it's time to create the API. Flask template can be found in the templates folder. 

We're done ! :zap::clapper: https://project3mjl-api-heroku.herokuapp.com/recommend/1 :clapper::zap:
